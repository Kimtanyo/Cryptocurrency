In other words, it’s a tradable digital asset. Cryptocurrency utilizes the idea of blockchain to secure the transactions. Currently, cryptocurrencies are widely adopted in many types of trading and they are also hit trends for people to invest. Even some celebrities would publicly share their opinion and their investment experience about the cryptocurrency. The most well-known example is Elon Musk, who supports Dogecoin in Twitter and it results in the soaring 20% of Dogecoin’s price. In recent years, the prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, shoot up dramatically, which is also another sign that the cryptocurreny market is trending. Nowadays, there are more than 6 thousands types of cryptocurrencies available in the market. Base on the information above, our team aims to investigate in the cryptocurrency market in this project. We hope to gain some insights from the market by visualizing their stock data using R. In this project, we select seven types of popular cryptocurrencies stocks, which have large “market cup” (calcualted by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation), in our analysis. The chosen cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, EthereumClassic, Ethereum, ReneSola and XRP. By analyzing the stock prices for the chosen cryptos, we hope to answer the following questions: Can we make use of features of data to establish a portfolio based on these cryptocurrencies’ stocks? When is a good time for investors to invest these cryptocurrencies and potentially gain the largest benefit? Which one of these cryptocurrencies is still worth investing in the future? In the following chapters, we will try to gain some insights from the visualization of the data. And we hope to use the insights to find the answer of the above questions. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources In order to analyze and gain some insights from the cryptocurrency market, out team chose seven types of popular cryptocurrencies stocks in this project. The chosen cryptos are Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, EthereumClassic, Ethereum, ReneSola and XRP. These cryptos all have large “market cup” (calcualted by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation), which reflect the popularity of the cryptos. After the researching, our team found that the cryptocurrency market became more stable and mature after the year of 2017 compared to the earlier stage. Thus, we decided to use the data from 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2020. To collect the stocks’ data, one of our teammate Candong pulled it from Yahoo Finance, which is a reliable and well-known platform for stocks. In the Historical Data session for each stock, we could apply the filter to select the range of date that we want. And then, we could download the each of the stock separately into csv files. Since we have the same range of date for all selected stock, the number of entries of each stock are expected to be the same, which is around 1100 records. Each of the stock would have 7 columns. The column names and the descriptions are as listed below. Column Data Type Description Date Date Year-Month-Day Open Numeric Open price of the stock High Numeric Highest price of the stock in this date Low Numeric Lowest price of the stock in this date Close Numeric Close price of the stock Adj Close Numeric The adjusted close price of the stock Volumne Numeric Number of share traded in this date for the stock As we preprocess the data and investigate it, we found that the number of records for ReneSola doesn’t match other stocks’. Having inconsistant number of records would be difficult for us to perform the analysis for this set of cryptos. The detailed information would be described in the Missing Data session. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Close &amp; Volume 3.2 Return &amp; Standardized Return 3.3 Monthly Return and Standardized Monthly Return 3.4 Close &amp; Standardized Close", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Originally, our team collected seven different cryptocurrency stocks (ADA, BTC, DOGE, ETC, ETH, SOL, XRP). One file for each stock contains the information of stocks, such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close and Volume. After investigating the missing data pattern, as described in the Missing values section, we decided to discard the SOL data in the analysis. In the following discussion, since we won’t be using Close values in the analysis, we called Adj Close to be Close for convenience. There are several different dataframes we used in the later analysis. We will briefly introduce each of them and show the structure of each dataframe. 3.1 Close &amp; Volume The first dataframe is mainly used to analyze whether there is relationship among Adj Close and Volumeof each stock. And we merged these three columns of each stock together in the same data frame by the date. The structure of the dataframe looks like: 3.2 Return &amp; Standardized Return In one of the analysis, the team tried to investigate in the relationship among the stocks in the perspective of their daily return. The daily return was calculated by: \\(return = (today&#39;s\\;close - yesterday&#39;s\\;close) / yeterday&#39;s\\;close\\). The team performed the analysis on both original return and the standardized return. The original return version looks like: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1091 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Date : Date, format: &quot;2018-01-02&quot; &quot;2018-01-03&quot; ... ## $ ADA_return: num 0.0539 0.2971 0.0345 -0.1146 0.0276 ... ## $ BTC_return: num 1324.9 218.9 398.2 1830.3 97.5 ... ## $ DOG_return: num 0.000236 0.000175 0.000324 0.002523 0.002696 ... ## $ ETC_return: num 0.7492 -0.0537 1.4546 -0.1185 2.2253 ... ## $ ETH_return: num 111.8 78.3 18.2 16.8 44 ... ## $ XRP_return: num 0.0899 0.6245 0.0913 -0.1479 0.0453 ... In the dataframe with standardized daily return, we standardized the daily return for each stock to perform a better analysis. The only difference compared to the previous dataframe is that for each column except the Year and Month column, we stored the standardized value. The dataframe is as shown below: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1091 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Date : Date, format: &quot;2018-01-02&quot; &quot;2018-01-03&quot; ... ## $ ADA_return: num 3.16 17.3 2.03 -6.63 1.63 ... ## $ BTC_return: num 3.511 0.549 1.029 4.864 0.223 ... ## $ DOG_return: num 0.831 0.62 1.136 8.758 9.358 ... ## $ ETC_return: num 0.8594 -0.0306 1.6413 -0.1024 2.4956 ... ## $ ETH_return: num 4.81 3.368 0.784 0.724 1.892 ... ## $ XRP_return: num 1.829 12.472 1.857 -2.905 0.941 ... 3.3 Monthly Return and Standardized Monthly Return The team tried to perform the analysis on monthly basis. In order to achieve the analysis, the set of dataframes with Year, Month, Monthly Average Close and the Standardized Month Average Close are used. The columns are as shown below: ## tibble [36 x 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ Year : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;2018&quot;,&quot;2019&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Month : Ord.factor w/ 12 levels &quot;1月&quot;&lt;&quot;2月&quot;&lt;&quot;3月&quot;&lt;..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ ADA_Adj.Close : num [1:36] 0.747 0.373 0.211 0.233 0.269 ... ## $ BTC_Adj.Close : num [1:36] 13086 9472 9041 8034 8451 ... ## $ DOGE_Adj.Close: num [1:36] 0.00958 0.00574 0.00389 0.0043 0.00432 ... ## $ ETC_Adj.Close : num [1:36] 33.6 30.3 20.6 17 18.5 ... ## $ ETH_Adj.Close : num [1:36] 1104 873 626 521 679 ... ## $ XRP_Adj.Close : num [1:36] 1.877 0.978 0.736 0.682 0.717 ...

We include the date and the closing prices for each stock in one data frame. The structure looks like: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1092 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Date : Date, format: &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &quot;2018-01-02&quot; ... ## $ ADA_Adj.Close : num 0.729 0.783 1.08 1.114 1 ... ## $ BTC_Adj.Close : num 13657 14982 15201 15599 17430 ... ## $ DOGE_Adj.Close: num 0.00891 0.00915 0.00932 0.00964 0.01217 ... ## $ ETC_Adj.Close : num 34.2 34.9 34.9 36.3 36.2 ... ## $ ETH_Adj.Close : num 773 884 963 981 998 ... ## $ XRP_Adj.Close : num 2.39 2.48 3.11 3.2 3.05 ... In the dataframe with standardized close, instead of containing the original stock prices, we standardized the prices for each stock to perform a better analysis. The structure of the last dataframe looks almost the same as the second one. The only difference is that for each column except the Date column, we store the standardized value instead of the originally price. The dataframe is as shown below: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1092 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Date : Date, format: &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &quot;2018-01-02&quot; ... ## $ ADA_Adj.Close : num 4.54 4.94 7.15 7.4 6.55 ... ## $ BTC_Adj.Close : num 1.35 1.71 1.77 1.88 2.38 ... ## $ DOGE_Adj.Close: num 3.59 3.74 3.85 4.06 5.65 ... ## $ ETC_Adj.Close : num 3.42 3.52 3.51 3.71 3.7 ... ## $ ETH_Adj.Close : num 1.94 2.43 2.77 2.85 2.92 ... ## $ XRP_Adj.Close : num 5.96 6.23 8.12 8.39 7.95 ... "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Data Pattern Detection 4.2 Missing Data Pattern After Removing SOL 4.3 Solution to the Missing Data", " Chapter 4 Missing values Our teams want to analyze the cryptocurrency market by analyzing seven chosen cryptos with large market cups. We aim to have seven stocks data within same range of date. We expected the seven stocks would all have data on each date when the stock market operates. In order to verify it, we performed the missing data pattern analysis. The result shows that there exists some missing data patterns in the stocks. The team investigated the patterns and gave the solution as described below. 4.1 Missing Data Pattern Detection By inspecting the plots above, we can notice that there exists some missing data patterns among the seven crypto stocks. The plot shows that there are two types of patterns. The first pattern shows that SOL crypto has some entries which other cryptos don’t have. Meanwhile, the other pattern indicates that there are missing entries which happen only on SOL crypto. It looks like SOL’s data is not consistent with other cryptos on the dates. However, other six cryptos seems to have consistent data. To gain more information about it, we looked at the number of null data for each column as shown below. ## Date ADA_Adj.Close ADA_Volume BTC_Adj.Close BTC_Volume ## 0 4 4 4 4 ## DOGE_Adj.Close DOGE_Volume ETC_Adj.Close ETC_Volume ETH_Adj.Close ## 4 4 4 4 4 ## ETH_Volume SOL_Adj.Close SOL_Volume XRP_Adj.Close XRP_Volume ## 4 341 341 4 4 The result shows that SOL has missing data on 341 rows while other cryptos all have 4 rows of missing data. Our team has the rough conclusion that SOL has inconsistant data with other cryptos. We verify the thought by removing the SOL related columns in the table and perform the analysis above again. 4.2 Missing Data Pattern After Removing SOL We now join the stock data of the chosen cryptos except SOL. And we plot the missing data pattern plot and the number of missing data rows again. ## Date ADA_Adj.Close ADA_Volume BTC_Adj.Close BTC_Volume ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## DOGE_Adj.Close DOGE_Volume ETC_Adj.Close ETC_Volume ETH_Adj.Close ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## ETH_Volume XRP_Adj.Close XRP_Volume ## 0 0 0 The results above show that the there isn’t any missing data now after removing the SOL stock data. It verifies our thought that SOL doesn’t have consistent data with other cryptos, while the rest of the six cryptos remain consistent. 4.3 Solution to the Missing Data Since the team aims to investigate the cryptocurrency market within a selected range of date, the data consistency is a crucial requirement in the project, especially when we need to involved the time feature in the analysis. Considering SOL is less popular among the seven chosen cryptos, after discussion, our team decided to remove SOL from the dataset in this project. Thus, the following analysis would be based on ADA, BTC, DOGE, ETC, ETH, XRP only. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and Dependency of Closing Price 5.2 Correlation between pairs of stocks 5.3 Time Series", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and Dependency of Closing Price 5.1.1 Color Palette We choose qualitative color palette to highlight visual differences between cryptocurrencies. Here we choose “Set2” in RColorBrewer. 5.1.2 Dependency between Volume and Closing price We try to find out if there is any dependency between volume and closing price so that we can combine them together to analyze later. The y-axis is limited by the difference of orders of magnitude between volume of each kind of cryptocurrency stock. Therefore, we have to split the figure of 6 lines to 6 figures as below. Note that the magnitude of volume is so large that almost all points gather at the lower left corner and we use log(Volume) instead of Volume. We can draw some conclusions below. Closing prices of each stock is independent of volumes of that because most points of each figure are distributed on a horizontal line respectively. Some stocks like ADA, DOGE and XRP, have similar outlier pattern. We should research their correlation later. Now We should drop volumes and only concentrate on closing prices. 5.1.3 Distribution of Closing Price First we want to research the changes of each stock over date. Limited by different magnitudes, we still have to draw 6 figures respectively. - Here we cannot say directly that which one is more worthy of investing because some stocks are so unstable that we don’t know whether the trend will continue in the next few days or months. From these figures above, we find that some stocks have similar distribution within a period of time (e.g. ADA and DOGE in 2020), which inspires us that we can suppose trends of some relatively stable stocks will continue for a period of time and use their trends to help to predict the future trend of some unstable stocks. It’s further researched in the part of time series analysis. 5.1.4 Distribution of Scaled Closing Price Considering finite funds of investors, some rising stocks like BTC seem currently promising but their prices are much higher than others too, which means that investors need to put more money first. Thus, we standardize all closing prices of each stock and draw a joint line chart and ridge line chart so that we can eliminate the effect of magnitude. Here we can draw some conclusions. BTC has three cluster center where a large number of standardized prices gather. It implies that BTC is unstable and the most difficult one to predict. However, BTC has extremely rising tendency which seems likely to return to the level of the beginning of 2018, so speculators may take the risk of stopping rising and a sharp decline to invest on it. At least a short-term investment on BTC is plausible. 5.2 Correlation between pairs of stocks 5.2.1 Correlation Analysis To solve unstability, we can research on correlation to use highly correlated stocks to help to predict. Thus, we first draw a matrix of scatterplots of closing prices of each stock to have a preliminary exploration on the correlation pattern. Then we draw a alluvial chart and a parallel coordinates chart. From the matrix of scatterplots, we can draw a conclusion that BTC have at least two correlation patterns. It’s the most distinctive one and the others do have linear or non-linear correlations to a certain extent. ## [1] &quot;English_United States.1252&quot; The alluvial chart visualizes the change of scaled closing prices in 6 stocks composition over time. If there is any intersection of different colored fills, it means that these intersected stocks have different changing tendencies during months of the intersection and they have poor correlation here. If not, we can say that they have great correlation. Note that because of standardization, it’s reasonable that the order of colored fills reverse when the scaled closing prices reverse, so we should just ignore this kind of intersections. Here we find the fact that monthly data correlations are highly obvious on every pair of stocks except those involving BTC and ETC. Correlation in 2020 is weaker than those in other years. We must further focus on 2020 by drawing a parallel coordinates chart with d3 because it’s the closest to the present and have the greatest effect on tendency predict. We can draw several conclusions on the data of monthly closing prices as below. ETH ,XRP and ADA have high correlation with each other in 2020. DOGE has high correlation with ADA since May in 2020. ETC and XRP has similar lagged tendency since March in 2020. BTC is the most distinctive one with tendency different from the others. 5.2.2 Correlation Coefficient We guess that whether correlations will be higher if we study the correlation of one-day trading returns rather than that of direct closing prices. Thus, we draw two correlation coefficient matrix plots based on one-day returns and daily closing prices. Note that standardization won’t change correlation coefficient so we can continue to use scaled data. Correlations of returns are much lower than those of closing prices, so we should discard our guess. BTC is almost uncorrelated with other stocks. Now we try to split the data to 3 different years and see if the correlation will fluctuate greatly. Different from what the monthly data shows in the previous alluvial chart, in terms of 2018, we find the daily data of each stock is highly correlated with each other. When eliminating BTC, the correlation in 2019 is merely little bit weaker than that in 2018. When eliminating ETC, the correlation in 2020 is merely little bit weaker than that in 2018. Eliminating BTC in 2019 and ETC in 2020, other stocks are significantly positively related with each other. 5.3 Time Series 5.3.1 Loess Smooth First let’s recall the distribution of closing prices of each stock and fit a smooth line by method of loess to see their tendency. It seems that ETH and BTC are rising and worthy of investment. However, We cannot judge whether the closing prices is greatly affected by irregular disturbances, which will cause wrong prediction of tendency. 5.3.2 STL Decomposition of BTC To separate long-term tendency, seasonal variation and irregular disturbance, we use STL decomposition of time series. Compared to classical decomposition, STL can get a stable decomposition without affected by outliers. However, STL is an additive decomposition, i.e. \\(Y=T+S+R\\). T, S and R mean trend factor, seasonal factor, remainder factor respectively. The seasonal factor contains both information about seasonality and periodicity. Additive decomposition has some disadvantages as below. When we predict the trend factor, additive decomposition lacks data in the beginning and the end because of moving average. It is insensitive to sharp increases and decreases and each component of it is too smooth, so it is difficult to capture influence of unexpected information. The prediction of its seasonal factor is so rigid. Its basic assumption is that the periodicity is fixed, and if its periodic fluctuation changes over time, additive decomposition cannot capture this information. Thus, we use multiplicative decomposition, i.e. \\(Y=T*S*R\\) instead. However, R doesn’t provide such an option. We apply logarithmic function to the original data and apply exponential function after composition when predicting. This lead to multiplicative decomposition \\(Y=\\exp(\\log(T)+\\log(S)+\\log(R))\\). Note that we use \\(BoxCox(x,\\lambda)\\) rather than logarithmic function here because when we choose \\(\\lambda=0\\) they are equivalent. In addition, when we choose \\(\\lambda=1\\) it’s equivalent to additive decomposition. We can see that BTC has a good rising trend as we analyze in the previous part. However, its remainder (i.e. irregular disturbance) is so unstable that the prediction of 30 days in the future has a decreasing trend. 5.3.3 Decomposition over Monthly Data Since we suppose investors do not speculate on these stocks expect for BTC, we can do decomposition on monthly time series rather than daily time series because we can reduce the number of predicting data (e.g. 6 months) to improve confidence level of our prediction. As we can see from each stock’s decomposition ADA and ETH have a great rising trend and rising seasonal factor but we should notice that ETH has unstable fluctuation which we will check on the daily time series later. ETC is unworthy of investing because its trend is too horizontal. XRP and DOGE has a good rising trend and stable random fluctuation but we should check on their prediction later. 5.3.4 Forecasts from STL We predict seasonal factor according to its periodicity and predict trend factor according to its loess curve. Then we combine them and get prediction of closing prices (\\(Y=\\exp(\\log(T)+\\log(S)+\\log(R))\\)). From 6-month forecasts of each stock, we can draw some conclusions as below. XRP will decrease steadily in the new few months so we should not invest on it. ADA and DOGE will fall steadily and then start to rebound in the next few month so we should buy in after the beginning of increasing. ETH has a relatively stable general rising prediction in the long term but as we said before, we should check its remainder outliers later. 5.3.5 Remainder Analysis Now we check the number of outliers of remainder. For simplicity, we regard those greater than \\(Q_{99}\\) or less than \\(Q_{1}\\) as outliers. Analyzing on remainders of the daily time series, we find that Remainder outliers of ETH gather in 2018. XRP is quite unstable recently and hard to predict. BTC and ETC have few outliers in 2020 which means they have extremely stable irregular fluctuation and their performances are almost completely influenced by their trend and seasonal factor. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Interactive Standardized Crypto Stocks 6.2 Interactive Single Stock", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this project, the team created two interactive plots to better show the relationship of the six cryptocurrencies. 6.1 Interactive Standardized Crypto Stocks We reproduced the line plot, where each stock data get standardized, into the interactive form. The reason of standardizing the data is that, some of the chosen stock has much higher price compared to the other. Plotting the stock prices with their original prices would make it hard to observe pattern of trends and relationships among the six cryptos. Thus, we used the standardized data for each stock and plot them together in the same graph. The graph looks almost the same as the one in the previous section. Users can directly see the standardized number of each stock when moving the mouse along the lines. The numbers can give users better understanding of how much drop/rise in some periods. For example, we can find that even though all six cryptos had a trend of decreasing around October 2018. Among the six cryptos Doge dropped the most. 6.2 Interactive Single Stock The second interactive graph is to show the single stock value. There are six tabs on the tops. Users can click on each tab to display the original single stock price. As mentioned previously, the price bases of the cryptos varied a lot. It’s meaningless to show their price together in the same graph. Considering people are usually more sensitive. Users can combine the price line with the plot in the last section to gain more understanding of a specific stock. For example, if a person want to invest in Doge, he/she can have a overall idea about whether Doge usually follows the trends of other cryptos. Also, to further investigate the trend of price of Doge, he/she can refer to the single line plot to check the price. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We first analyzed stock closing prices of 6 popular cryptocurrencies by researching on distribution and dependency relation of closing price to get a preliminary exploration of data features. And then we studied the correlation between each pair of stocks to improve our time series prediction later. Finally, we regarded closing prices as time series, decomposed them by method of STL and predicted their performances in the next few months. Combining our findings in these three parts, we can solve the problems mentioned in Chapter 1 Introduction. Can we make use of features of data to establish a portfolio based on these cryptocurrencies’ stocks? We find these cryptocurrencies have similar distribution density except BTC (after standardization). Furthermore, if we focus on 2020, each stock except ETC has great positive correlation. The correlation coefficient between BTC and ETH even rises up to 0.94, which means we can decide our investment strategy on BTC according to the changes of ETH. Here we cannot directly use the STL prediction of BTC to make a long-term investment plan because the irregular disturbance of BTC is extremely unstable on daily data. ETC is unworthy of investing because its trend is too horizontal. XRP will decrease steadily in the new few months so we should not solely invest on it. ADA and DOGE will fall steadily and then start to rise steadily in the next few month so we can buy in after the beginning of increasing. ETH has a relatively stable general rising prediction in the long term. Most of it irregular fluctuations gather in 2018 and it’s remainders are relatively stable since 2019. Thus, ETh is worthy of investment in the long term. To sum up, we can establish a portfolio consisting of ADA, DOGE and ETH. Note that we can only speculate on BTC according to the detailed daily changes of ETH rather than make a long term plan on it. When is a good time for investors to invest these cryptocurrencies and potentially gain the largest benefit? The best time to invest on BTC is as soon as possible. Its rising trend is likely to last for a few days so that we should quickly buy in right now and sell out at saddle points when it tends to flatten. The best time to invest on ADA and DOGE is when it start to rebounce after the steady decrease in a few months. The best time to invest on ETH is when it starts to stablize for a few months. The best time to invest on XRP is when we decide to buy in ETH according to their high positive correlation. We do not recommend invest on ETC because it’s too flat. Which one of these cryptocurrencies is still worth investing in the future? ADA, DOGE and ETH have great rising trend and their irregular disturbances are also relatively stable so they are still worth investing and holding for a long term. Our analysis meets our goal so that we solved our investigation problems. Furthermore, it can be also generalized to other stocks but these 6 representative popular crypocurrencies are enough for rookie investors to establish a portfolio and construct their investing strategy. In this project, we focus on our visualization instead of algorithms and models but we can still improve our prediction by several methods as below.
